          Set in a secluded location at the top of its own private valley looking to the sea, 
          Santill√°n is a 5 hectare estate with a retreat centre at its heart.</p>

          Located in the peace of the Spanish countryside, and yet conveniently 
          only 35 minutes from Malaga airport, you can immerse yourself 
          in the peaceful sounds of nature in its lovely gardens 
          and surrounding hills. It is the perfect setting for our retreat. </p>
