      <p>We are drawing from our experience on dancing and teaching tango and working in areas of personal development. 
      <p>This is a collaboration between two schools, <i>Dance in Conversation</i> and <i>Despertango</i>, putting together resources focused on relationships, authentic expression and spirituality. 
      <p>We are bringing our experience on coaching couples and using tools like Family Constellations. 
      <p>This retreat benefits from our deep work and training on somatic therapy and embodiment practices. </p>
