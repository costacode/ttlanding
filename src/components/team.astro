          Ennio Fioramonti is a Tango Maestro with a passion for personal development, 
          and over three decades of tango experience. Ennio lived several years in Buenos Aires, 
          which changed the way he connects in tango and in life. He has taught tango in France, Germany, 
          Italy, and Spain.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          Ennio has also earned degrees in biology and psychology. While leading groups for personal 
          development in Italy, Argentina, and Spain, he was using transformative tools 
          such as Family Constellations and the analysis of Archetypes.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          Tango and psychology transformed his way of seing tango, which resulted in the unique project 
          “Despertango”. Born in Argentina alongside Adriana Mazzotta, it seamlessly intertwines tango 
          with the realms of psychology and archetypes. This transformative initiative aims to connect 
          the body with emotions and expression, allowing individuals to explore themselves 
          through tango and to connect deeply with the other in an authentic way.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          As the organizer of two lively milongas and a practica in Malaga, Spain, Ennio fosters 
          a nurturing environment where dancers of all levels can come together, share their love 
          for tango, and embark on a profound journey of authentic self-expression.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          In a lot of ways, tango has become the catalyst for a profound transformation in his life. 
          It has guided him away from the pursuit of security, leading him towards a more intuitive 
          and joyous existence. Moreover, tango has bestowed upon him remarkable encounters, 
          including the serendipitous union with the woman who would become his life companion.</p>

        I am a relationship coach and a tango dancer.</p>
        <p class="text-offset text-sm">
        In tango we often start our journey by developing our physical and technical abilities to be able to dance. 
        Early in my own journey I've started to see that there is so much more in tango than just our ability to move to the music in a beautiful way. 
        To me learning tango often involves emotional and spiritual aspects of our development.
        Dancing tango I have learnt to work on the level of energy and  intentions. 
        I am a strong believer that the type of energy work that we practice in tango transpires in other areas in our lives and can enrich our relationships, communication with others, builds our inner core and helps us heal. 
        <p class="text-offset text-sm">
        I am also a strong believer that when we are able to work with emotions and our hearts in  a supportive and creative way, our ability to dance with connection, fluidity and easiness expands. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-offset text-sm">
        With my background in coaching and supporting people from all walks of life, 
        my purpose is to help individuals and couples to discover how they can use energy 
        and intention to support their own personal growth in tango and in their relationship 
        with themselves and others

          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          Jesus co-founded Dance in Conversation in 2020. It was a moment when all dances came to a standstill and a space for verbal expression and sharings become a necessity 
          in the tango community. For him it was about co-creating and sharing his own musings coming from dancing and intentional movement.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          Following his experience with 5Rhythms, Jesus embraced dance as a source of inspiration for living his life. He believes that learning and practicing a dance like tango can lead us to walk with purpose.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          For more than a decade, he worked for the BBC and media outlets, nurturing a talent to find stories and reach people, but it was the years he spent in a monastery in Mexico, where he learnt to sense and inhabit that wondrous energy that connect us all and makes us better dancers.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          Embodying that energy more consciously is his current endeavour, immersing himself fully in an intense training on somatic therapy and embodied intimacy.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          On a good day, he celebrates life like a baby wolf howling to the moon. When things get rough, he needs his twin, his beloved, and the nourishment of his community to get him back on track.</p>
