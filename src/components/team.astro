          Jesus co-founded Dance in Conversation in 2020. It was a moment when all dances came to a standstill and a space for verbal expression and sharings become a necessity 
          in the tango community. For him it was about co-creating and sharing his own musings coming from dancing and intentional movement.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          Since then, Jesus embraced tango as a source of inspiration for living his life. He believes that learning and practicing tango can lead us to walk with purpose.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          For more than a decade, he worked for the BBC and media outlets, nurturing a talent to find stories and reach people, but it was the years he spent in a monastery in Mexico, where he learnt to sense and inhabit that wondrous energy that connect us all and makes us better dancers.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          Embodying that energy more consciously is his current endeavour, immersing himself fully in an intense training on somatic therapy and embodied intimacy.</p>
          <p class="text-offset text-sm">
          On a good day, he celebrates life like a baby wolf howling to the moon. When things get rough, he needs his twin, his beloved, and the nourishment of his community to get him back on track.</p>

        I am a relationship coach and a tango dancer.</p>
        <p class="text-offset text-sm">
        In tango we often start our journey with developing our physical and technical abilities to be able to dance. However as a relationships coach 
        I have discovered and focusing exclusively physical development  is not enough. Learning tango often involves emotional and spiritual aspects of our development, 
        therefore to be able to know how to support it is essential to enable a fulfilling and enriching tango journey for our tango communities. 
        When we are able to respond to studentâ€™s emotional and spiritual needs, their learning journey can not only be faster, but healing in many ways as well. </p>
        <p class="text-offset text-sm">
        With my background in coaching and supporting people from all walks of life, 
        I bring a holistic approach to supporting individuals as well as couples in their learning process in tango.</p>
